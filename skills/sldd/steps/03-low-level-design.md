# Step 03: Low-Level Design and Version Policy

## Objective

Produce approved low-level design and version policy aligned to Step 02, tracing Step 01 requirements and Step 02 decisions to contracts, data models, errors, tests, dependencies, and implementation order.

## Gate + Resume Checks

- Require Step 01 and Step 02 complete.
- For existing codebases, require Step 99 complete and current.
- Reject implementation/test generation at this step.
- Reject inconsistent journal states.

## Draft Output

Load `templates/03-low-level-design-and-version-policy.md` before drafting the artifact.

Use `00-exploration-summary.md` only as non-binding context for rationale, alternatives, assumptions, and candidate technical ideas. Approved numbered artifacts override it.

Map Step 01 requirements and Step 02 design choices into concrete low-level decisions and an ordered implementation plan.

The draft must explicitly state:

- how each approved requirement is covered by API contracts, data models, error handling, tests, or implementation steps
- which Step 02 design decisions constrain Step 04 tests and Step 05 implementation
- whether the current dependency set is sufficient
- which new dependencies are required, if any
- why each dependency is needed
- version pinning or compatibility constraints for each new dependency
- the impact on runtime behavior, tests, and maintenance

Wait for approval.

## Approval Protocol

- Save or update artifacts only after explicit approval.
- On rejection, requested changes, hold, or ambiguous approval, do not persist progress; clarify or wait.
- If writes are unavailable, stop and report the limitation.

## Save Flow After Approval

1. Save only Step 03 content to the resolved workflow directory as `03-low-level-design-and-version-policy.md`; for new workflows, this is `.sldd/specs/<feature-name>/03-low-level-design-and-version-policy.md`.
2. Mark Step 03 as `complete` in journal-only `_spec-journal.json` with the artifact link.
3. Ask whether to continue to the next step or hold.

For legacy or user-provided workflow paths, save and update progress in the resolved directory instead.

## Response Format

1. Gate and resume check result
2. Draft summary with required Step 03 headings
3. Approval request
4. Continue/hold prompt
